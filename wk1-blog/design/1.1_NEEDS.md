# NEEDS

This document specifies customer needs for the 52vibes blog platform — a static website to document a year-long AI agent collaboration experiment. The blog MUST serve developers, AI researchers, and product managers. It MUST be fast, accessible, and maintainable without requiring complex infrastructure.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

## PROJECT THEMES

The 52vibes project is organized into four quarterly themes. Each week's blog post MUST be associated with one of these themes:

| Quarter | Weeks | Theme | Description |
|---------|-------|-------|-------------|
| Q1 | 1-13 | Agentic Infrastructure | Building foundational tools and frameworks for AI agent collaboration |
| Q2 | 14-26 | Production Tools | Real-world tools that push agent limits in practical settings |
| Q3 | 27-39 | Complex Workflows | Multi-step, multi-stakeholder challenges and human-in-the-loop systems |
| Q4 | 40-52 | Synthesis & Edge Cases | Edge case exploration, meta-analysis, and final reporting |
