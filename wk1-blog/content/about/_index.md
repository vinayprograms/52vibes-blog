---

52vibes is a year-long experiment in human-AI collaboration. Each week, we ship a working project while documenting the process of building with AI agents.

## The Experiment

- **52 weeks** of consistent, shipped work
- **Real projects** solving real problems
- **Transparent process** through session logs
- **Evolving patterns** in human-AI collaboration

## Themes

| Quarter | Theme | Focus |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Q1 | Agentic Infrastructure | Tools, workflows, foundations |
| Q2 | Production Tools | Practical utilities, integrations |
| Q3 | Complex Workflows | Multi-agent, orchestration |
| Q4 | Synthesis | Edge cases, refinement |

## Philosophy

Every project follows these principles:

1. **Ship something** — Working code over perfect code
2. **Document everything** — Session logs capture the journey
3. **Learn publicly** — Share failures and successes
4. **Build foundations** — Each week builds on the last
