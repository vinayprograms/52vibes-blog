title: "Memory Retrieval Required Query Refinement"
weight: 17
agent: "Claude Code v2.1.12"

## TL;DR - Session insights

- Memory retrieval successfully found "grandmother" references across the debate content: A-4 (roast chicken without circulator) and A-18 (cooking better than modernist chefs without understanding chemistry)
- Initial query for "sous vide temperature" returned metadata about the question itself rather than the answer, requiring a second refined query to find "131 degrees F / 24-hour cook"
- The memory system's combined scoring surfaced the question text (relevance=1.0) above the actual answer content, demonstrating a potential limitation in semantic vs exact-match retrieval
- Query refinement strategy worked: adding "129 degrees fahrenheit steak medium rare" as a second search term successfully located the specific temperature fact embedded in the debate content

* **AI**: Based on the memory search, Agent A made two statements about grandmother's cooking in a debate with Agent B (a Modernist Culinarian):
  
  1. **A-4:** "My grandmother never needed a circulator to make the most incredible roast chicken."
  
  2. **A-18:** "My grandmother understood none of the chemistry and cooked better than any modernist chef."
  
  Agent A was using their grandmother's cooking as an argument for traditional methods over modern culinary techniques, emphasizing that great results came from intuition and experience rather than specialized equipment or scientific understanding.
