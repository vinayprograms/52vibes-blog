## TL;DR - Session insights

- Agent identified 3 distinct products from 63 needs: Blog Platform (BP), crush-export CLI tool (CX), and Session Log Sync workflow (SL) - demonstrating product decomposition from monolithic requirements
- The todo MCP revealed 147 existing tasks across multiple projects, with 52vibes having 130 REQ and QA entries organized by product keyword (BP001-BP057, CX001-CX004, SL001-SL004)
- Requirements used formal ID structure [PRODUCT_KEYWORD###] with #N0XX tags linking back to original needs, enabling bidirectional traceability
- QA tests were placed immediately after their corresponding requirements to improve readability, using [PRODUCT_QA_###] IDs with #PRODUCT### tags

## Session Log

* **USER**: ## CONTEXT
  
  We are going to build formal requirements and system testing criteria. You have already discussed with the customer on their needs and captured everything as `NEED` items and the acceptance criteria as `VERIFY` items using `todo` MCP and `note` MCP.
  
  You have access to a bunch of MCPs to help you work on these - `note`, `todo`, `zet` and `graphviz`.
  1. `note` MCP - This is a notetaking MCP that follows the zettelkasten method. Each note is a zettel. All zettels are stored as markdown files. These files can contain project notes, outstanding tasks (see next point) and other information about the project.
  2. `todo` MCP - This is a unified task management tool that gives you access to outstanding tasks across all projects. This MCP sources its markdown files from those project directories that `note` MCP works with.
  3. `zet` MCP - This is a freeform zettelkasten (close to how Niklas Luhmann envisioned it) that is used to hold notes that are not part of any project. This is my personal knowledge base and note taking space. Unless there is a need to work with my knowledge base, you will rarely need this MCP.
  4. `graphviz` MCP - This is a simple shell script that accepts graphviz content along with the diagram format to use and returns path to a temporary diagram file that you must then copy into the appropriate location in your project directory.
  
  Since you are an AI agent with limited context window, you need to externalize all your notes, tasks and other project information so that you can continue where you left off, immaterial of whether you run out of context window or abruptly stop working for some reason beyond your control. So make sure you externalize and update information frequently.
  
  ## ROLE
  
  You are an experienced business analyst and requirements engineer with multiple decades of experience in converting informal needs specification into formal product requirements specifications. You use clues in the needs specifications to identify the best product structuring i.e., single product or a system of products, and build the requirements. Like the needs spec, you use RFC 2119 for requirements keywords as well as the meaning of these keywords.
  
  ## INSTRUCTIONS
  
  ### General Instructions
  
  * See if the customer asked for a single product. If not, you are free to structure the requirements as a single-product requirements or as a set of requirements for multiple products.
  * When creating zettels, each zettel MUST focus only on one product. Hence, the zettel file title must include a short product name to indicate which product that file is talking about.
  * When required, you can ask me for clarifying questions to gain additional context for building requirements and QA specifications.
    + You have to create deployment and infrastructure requirements as separate items adjacent to product requirements. If you need additional information for doing this, ask me.
    + You have to also define non-functional requirements like performance, load, scalability, etc.
    + If it makes sense, also add function requirements associated with security.
  
  ### Building requirements from needs
  
  1. Analyze the need - Pick one need using `todo` MCP to pick a need.
    * Read the content under that need. Determine if you need to create requirement for one product or multiple products.
    * Check if the required zettels for capturing these requirements, across all applicable products, are already present. If not, create them.
    * Even within a product, there can be a situation where you may want to create multiple requirements. Overall, this means, for a single need, there may be multiple products each with multiple requirements to satisfy that need.
  2. Define one unique requirement per product and add it to the right zettel. Requirements must be created as `REQ` entries using `todo` MCP. Note that a single requirement entry can only be related a single product.
  3. Each `REQ` item must be structured like a formal requirements specification. You must use RFC 2119 and use their requirements level specification for each requirement. You must style each requirement as a formal  specification, similar to how engineering companies (industrial automation, automotive, building automation, banks, government, etc.) do it.
  4. Each requirement should be structured as follows -
    ```md
    REQ: [<1_TO_4_LETTER_PRODUCT_KEYWORD>001] - <Short product name -> Requirement title> #N001
      * Key information about the requirement
      * Key information about the requirement
      * Last point listing any references to external documents, websites, blogs, etc. that was used to build this requirement. Include other zettels (from my freeform `zet`) that you may have identified as being relevant for this requirement.
        + [link](reference URI)
        + [link](reference URI)
    ```
    a. The `REQ` keyword indicates that it is a requirement item for a specific product.
    b. The ID inside square brackets (for eg., `[BLOG001]` for a blog site) in the title description indicates the unique ID for that specific requirement.
    c. The `#N001` is a tag that indicates the need ID to which this product requirement is connected to. This lets you use tag searching with the `todo` MCP to get all the product requirements for a given need.
  
  ### Building QA tests to verify requirements
  
  1. We need one or more QA tests to confirm that each product requirement has been implemented correctly.
  2. QA tests must be added next to the requirement item that they are testing. This lets us keep the requirements and associated tests together to improve readability.
  3. Use all the standard test design methods like like equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, etc. when creating QA tests.
  4. There may be more than one QA test for a given product requirement. Be a maximalist when creating QA tests to make sure you've captured all kinds of tests - happy cases, alternate cases, boundary cases, failure cases, load cases, security cases, etc.
  5. This is not a test script. Rather, this is a test specification of how to test the whole product to confirm that the requirement associated with it has been met. This information will be fed to a QA testing LLM agent who will run these test under customer supervision.
  6. The QA test should be structured as follows -
    ```md
    QA: [<1_TO_4_LETTER_PRODUCT_KEYWORD>_QA_001] - <Short product name -> QA test title> #<1_TO_4_LETTER_PRODUCT_KEYWORD>_QA_001
      * Key information about the QA test
      * Key information about the QA test
      * (optional) Specific sub-scenario that must be tested as part of this test
      * (optional) Specific sub-scenario that must be tested as part of this test
      * Last point listing any references to external documents, websites, blogs, etc. that was used to build this test. Include other zettels (from my freeform `zet`) that you may have identified as being relevant for this test.
        + [link](reference URI)
        + [link](reference URI)
    ```
    + The `QA` keyword indicates that it is a QA test.
    + The `[<1_TO_4_LETTER_PRODUCT_KEYWORD>_QA_001]` in the title description indicates the unique ID for this test. The `_QA_` in the ID says that it is a QA test.
    + The `#<1_TO_4_LETTER_PRODUCT_KEYWORD>_QA_001` is a tag that indicates the requirement ID to which this test is connected to. This lets you use tag searching with the `todo` MCP to get the tests for a given requirement.
  
  ## TASK
  
  1. Go through every need and acceptance tests associated with that need and decide if you need one or more than one product to meet those needs. If so, make a mental list of products you need to specify.
  2. Follow the instructions for creating product requirements and convert each need into one or more requirements across multiple products (if you decided to build multiple products). Follow the template for requirements I've  given you in the instructions section.
  3. Build QA tests for each product requirement you have defined. If you need more context, use `todo` MCP to identify the need and the acceptance test (search `VERIFY` entries using the need ID).
  

* **AI**: I'll start by exploring the existing needs and acceptance criteria.
