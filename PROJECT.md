# 52vibes: Year-Long AI Agent Collaboration Study

**Start Date:** January 1, 2025 (Thursday)  
**End Date:** December 31, 2025  
**Domain:** https://52vibes.dev  
**Repository:** https://github.com/vinayprograms/52vibes-blog (blog)

## Purpose

Push the limits of AI agents to identify their limits, shortcomings, and missing aspects of an agentic ecosystem. Define boundaries of human-agent interactions and produce comprehensive recommendations for human-AI collaboration.

---

## Audience

- Developers
- AI Researchers
- Product Managers

---

## Tools

- **LLM:** Claude Opus 4.5
- **Agent Interface:** github.com/charmbracelet/crush
- **Hosting:** Cloudflare Pages

---

## Project Philosophy

1. **Agent-first** - AI leads, human intervenes only when blocked
2. **Fail fast, document deeply** - Limitations become artifacts themselves
3. **Compounding artifacts** - Package → CLI → Service progression
4. **Weekly shipped artifacts** - Every week produces production-grade output

---

## Selection Criteria

| Criterion | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Tests new agent capability | 40% |
| Compounds on prior work | 30% |
| Produces useful artifact | 30% |

**Non-negotiable:** Must fit 1-week time budget (scope/capabilities adjusted as needed)

---

## Artifact Requirements

- **Required:** Reusable library/package/SDK
- **Optional additions:** CLI, service, template, framework (based on project need)
- **Exception:** Research-only artifacts when exploration week is justified

---

## Schedule

- **Cycle:** Thursday → Wednesday
- **Base budget:** 10-20 hours/week
- **High availability:** Weekends, holidays
- **Low availability:** Thursdays, Tuesdays (commute days)
- **Stretch:** Possible but not habitual

---

## Reporting Cadence

- **Weekly:** Blog post documenting work
- **Monthly:** Summary report (Weeks 1-4, 5-8, etc.)
- **Quarterly:** Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 comprehensive reports
- **Yearly:** Final comprehensive collaboration report

---

## Documentation

- **Conversations:** `./.crush` directory
- **Agent context:** `docs/AGENTS.md`
- **Code:** With build instructions
- **Public:** Everything version-controlled on GitHub

---

## Failure Protocol

When a project fails or partially ships:

1. Document limitations that caused failure
2. Identify responsibility (human vs. AI)
3. Propose alternatives to prevent recurrence
4. If pivoting: still produce reduced-scope artifact
5. Failure documentation becomes part of the artifact

## Themes

| Quarter | Weeks | Theme |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Q1 | 1-13 | Agentic Infrastructure |
| Q2 | 14-26 | Production Tools |
| Q3 | 27-39 | Complex Workflows |
| Q4 | 40-52 | Synthesis & Edge Cases |
